# MoneyOXR

A [Money](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money)-compatible rate store that uses exchange rates from openexchangerates.org.

A few improvements over the existing [money-open-exchange-rates](https://github.com/spk/money-open-exchange-rates) gem:

* Uses BigDecimal instead of Float for exchange rates.
* Automatically caches API results to file if a :cache_path option is provided.
* Automatically fetches new data from API if data becomes stale if a :max_age option is provided.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'money-oxr'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install money-oxr

## Usage

With the gem, you do not need to manually add exchange rates. Calling, `MoneyOXR::RatesStore#load` will
either load the rates from the cache file or download the rates from the API and create the file depending
on your options.

``` ruby
require 'money_oxr/bank'
Money.default_bank = MoneyOXR::Bank.new(
  app_id: 'abcd1234',
  cache_path: 'config/oxr.json',
  max_age: 86400
)

MoneyOXR::RatesStore.new({
  app_id: 'abcd1234',
  cache_path: 'config/oxr.json',
  max_age: 86400
}).load
```

If you only want to load data from a file without ever fetching from the API,
the :app_id and :max_age options are not necessary.

``` ruby
require 'money_oxr/bank'
Money.default_bank = MoneyOXR::Bank.new(
  cache_path: 'config/oxr.json'
)

MoneyOXR::RatesStore.new({
  cache_path: 'config/oxr.json',
}).load
```

### :source

If you are on a paid plan from openexchangerates.org and you wish to use a different
source currency, you may provide it with the :source option. The default is `USD`.

``` ruby
require 'money_oxr/bank'
Money.default_bank = MoneyOXR::Bank.new(
  app_id: 'abcd1234',
  cache_path: 'config/oxr.json',
  max_age: 86400,
  source: 'GBP'
)
```

## Development
